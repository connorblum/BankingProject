# BankingProject
First JAVA project, a simple banking application functioning in the console window.

When the application is first run this is the screen that is printed to the console window:

Selecting option 1 prints out that users current balance, as you can see below the default is set at Â£0.00:

Selecting option 2 allows for the user to select how much money to deposit into the account,
as you can see below the user has chosen 10000:

When selecting option 1, you can now see their balance has been updated:

If the user selects an option outside of the target window then they will be prompted with this message
and the loop will continue without crashing:

Selecting option 3 promts the user to enter an ammount that they wish to withdraw,
as you can see below they have chosen 5000:

Selecting option 4 shows the user what their last transaction was,
be it a deposit or a withdrawl:
